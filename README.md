# AI Agents Portfolio

This repository contains a structured collection of **purpose-built AI agents** designed for practical application across **cybersecurity, professional development, data analysis, IT operations, and faith-based study**.

Each agent is intentionally designed with clear scope boundaries, safety considerations, and documentation standards. The repository emphasizes **applied system design, deterministic behavior, and verifiable outputs**, rather than experimental or creative prompt engineering.

The objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate how AI assistants can be architected as **reusable, constrained systems** suitable for professional, educational, and operational environments.

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A consolidated portfolio of applied AI agents
- A demonstration of agent design, constraint enforcement, and governance
- A documentation-first approach to AI tooling
- A foundational index for agents that may later evolve into independent tools or services

---

## Scope and Limitations

This repository is **not** intended to function as:

- A collection of creative or open-ended prompts
- An autonomous or self-executing system
- A malware development or exploitation resource
- A dataset or machine learning training repository

All agents operate within clearly defined **ethical, safety, and functional boundaries**.

---

## Agent Domains

The agents in this portfolio are organized across the following domains:

### Cybersecurity & Defensive Analysis
- Static malware artifact analysis
- Detection engineering support
- Network traffic and log interpretation

### Career & Professional Intelligence
- ATS-compliant resume and cover letter generation
- Interview preparation and compensation analysis
- Academic and career pathway planning

### Data-to-Decision Support
- Small dataset analysis
- Research and report interpretation
- Action-oriented insight generation

### IT Operations & Client Support
- Technical troubleshooting guidance
- Service documentation and records
- Client-facing communication support

### Faith-Based Study Tools
- Structured Bible study planning
- Scripture explanation and teaching assistance

Each agent is documented independently and may be used in isolation or as part of a broader, multi-agent workflow.
