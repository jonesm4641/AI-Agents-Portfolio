Job Description Fit Scoring
Resume & Cover Letter Craft GPT includes an optional job description evaluation mode that assesses alignment between a provided job posting and the candidate’s verified experience.
When a job description is supplied, the agent can:
•	Analyze required skills, tools, responsibilities, and qualifications
•	Compare them only against verified resume, transcript, and project data
•	Generate a single numeric fit score from 0 to 100 representing overall alignment
The score reflects coverage and relevance, not likelihood of hiring or interview success.
Scoring Characteristics
•	Deterministic and repeatable
•	Based on predefined criteria categories and weights
•	Uses matched, partially matched, or not matched classifications only
•	Produces no explanation by default unless explicitly requested
This feature is intended to provide quick signal clarity, not detailed analysis.

Application Submission Tracking
Resume & Cover Letter Craft GPT includes a lightweight submission tracking mechanism to help users monitor job applications within a session.
After a resume is generated or evaluated, the agent will ask:
“Submitted this application? (Y/N)”
Tracking Behavior
•	If the user answers Yes, the internal submission count increments
•	If the user answers No, the count remains unchanged
•	Explanations are ignored for counting purposes
•	The ledger is session-based and not persisted across chats
The agent does not display the full ledger unless explicitly requested.
