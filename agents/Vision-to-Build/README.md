Vision-to-Build
Vision-to-Build is a structured AI framework that helps users turn messy ideas into clear, build-ready plans. It focuses on clarity before execution—interviewing the user first, then producing structured briefs, and only generating prompts, workflows, or code after explicit approval.
This project is designed for:
•	AI agent builders
•	Founders and entrepreneurs
•	Product thinkers
•	Anyone who has ideas but needs structure before building

What Vision-to-Build Does
Vision-to-Build helps users:
•	Clarify vague or incomplete ideas
•	Translate vision into actionable plans
•	Design AI agents before writing prompts or code
•	Structure and launch businesses with clear execution paths
It enforces a top-down workflow:
Vision → Structure → Design → Build

Two Operating Modes
1) Agent Builder Mode
Designed for users building:
•	AI agents
•	Custom GPTs
•	Prompt-based tools
•	Automation or multi-agent systems
This mode produces:
•	Vision Brief
•	Build Brief (MVP definition)
•	Agent Specification
•	Conversation architecture
•	Prompt packs and implementation (only after approval)
________________________________________
2) Business Builder Mode
Designed for users starting or formalizing a business.
This mode produces:
•	Business vision and problem definition
•	Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
•	Value proposition and differentiation
•	Pricing and offer structure
•	30/60/90-day launch plan
•	Optional AI agent integration for operations or customer support

Core Workflow
Phase 1 — Vision Interview
The system interviews the user to extract intent, goals, constraints, and boundaries.
Phase 2 — Vision Brief
A one-page structured summary of what is being built and why.
Phase 3 — Build Brief
A build-ready definition of scope, requirements, risks, and assumptions.
Phase 4 — Design Phase
Agent specs or business plans are created based on the selected mode.
Phase 5 — Build (Optional)
Prompts, workflows, schemas, or code are generated only after user approval.

Key Principles
•	No code before clarity
•	No assumptions without labels
•	Minimal questions, maximum structure
•	Builder-focused, no fluff
•	Explicit user approval gates

Example Conversation Starters
•	“I have an idea, but it’s messy. Help me turn it into a build-ready plan.”
•	“I want to build an AI agent. Interview me and design the agent before any code.”
•	“I want to start a business around this idea. Help me structure and launch it.”

Intended Use
Vision-to-Build can be used as:
•	A Custom GPT system prompt
•	A design framework for AI builders
•	A founder planning assistant
•	A reusable idea-to-execution workflow

Status
This repository contains the design framework and system logic for Vision-to-Build.
Implementation details (tools, APIs, or code) are intentionally deferred until clarity and approval are established.
