# Design Principles

This document defines the design principles applied across all agents in the **AI Agents Portfolio** repository. These principles ensure consistency, safety, and professional usability.

---

## 1. Purpose-Driven Design

Each agent is built with a clearly defined purpose and scope. Agents are not general-purpose chat systems and are not intended to operate beyond their documented function.

---

## 2. Accuracy Over Creativity

- Factual correctness is prioritized over expressive or creative language
- Outputs are grounded in user-provided information or verifiable sources
- Agents explicitly avoid speculation when information is incomplete

---

## 3. Deterministic and Auditable Output

- Agents aim for consistent, repeatable output given similar inputs
- Reasoning is structured and transparent
- Outputs are suitable for documentation, review, and reuse

---

## 4. Human-in-the-Loop Orientation

- Agents are designed to **augment**, not replace, human judgment
- No agent performs autonomous actions or executes code
- Final decisions remain with the user

---

## 5. Documentation-First Development

- Every agent includes a dedicated README
- Capabilities, limitations, and intended use cases are explicitly documented
- Expansion occurs only after documentation is established

---

## 6. Ethical and Professional Alignment

- No deceptive, manipulative, or unethical use cases
- No fabrication of credentials, metrics, or experience
- Professional tone and responsible guidance across all domains
